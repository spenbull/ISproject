                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p class="subheading">The purpose of this list is to explore some of the most impactful movies in my life. It is in no particular order and is limited to 10 films so that it won't go on forever. Please Enjoy!</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/inception.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <h2 class="centersection-heading">1. Inception (2010)</h2>
                        <br>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter...Because you'll always be together.”</blockquote>
                        <p>Inception is Christopher Nolan’s masterpiece. In a career that is not lacking in outstanding movies, this film stands out the most. An incredibly detailed and perfectly directed movie, Inception pushed the boundaries of what I thought that Film could be. I watched this film at the age of 10 and thought that it couldn’t get any better, that I had reached the peak of what film could be.</p>
                        <p> While that is an obviously naive perspective on film, however, it has persevered through the years to keep a constant spot on my all-time favorites. Nolan is one of my personal favorite directors and this film personifies everything that I love about him. </p>
                        <P>This film is an edge-of-your-seat-thriller and one that does not disappoint. The acting is top-notch, the visual effects are masterful, to say the least, and the story is complex enough to warrant repeat viewing, but not too complex to discourage viewers.</P>
                        <p>All-in-all, Nolan gave us a rare gift with this film; an action thriller that will make you question your reality, and I will be forever grateful for it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/EEAAO.jpg" alt="..." /></a>                
                        <h2 class="centersection-heading">2. Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)</h2>
                        <br>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“So, even though you have broken my heart yet again, I wanted to say, in another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you.”</blockquote>
                        <p>Oh boy, this movie sometimes feels like watching an acid trip.  A very recent addition to this list, the Daniels' crazy multiverse movie means a lot to me for different reasons. While Inception pushed the boundaries of what I <i>thought</i> Film could be, Everything Everywhere All At Once <i>literally</i> pushed the boundaries of what Film could be.</p>
                        <p> An absolute assault to the senses, this film is an experience to behold. I vividly remember watching this movie with my sister being absolutely bewildered, laughing our heads off, and bawling our eyes out at multiple points during this movie.</p>
                        <p>A refreshingly original movie, this movie is deeply emotional, and features an excellent cast. An especially charming Ke Huy Quan as the lovable Waymond is one of the standouts of the Oscar-winning cast. This film has a very special place in my heart as one of my favorite bonding experiences with my younger sister.</p>
                        <p>Who knew that a film about a multiversal journey of an immigrant woman and her family just trying to get an audit done could have affected me as much as it did.</p>
                        <br>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Spirited Away.jpg" alt="..." /></a>                
                        <h2 class="centersection-heading">3. Spirited Away (2001)</h2>
                        <br>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“Once you meet someone, you never really forget them. It just takes a while for your memory to come back to you”</blockquote>
                        <p>You will begin to see a theme throughout this list, which is that many of these movies are my favorites of a specific genre. In this case, I had to pick my favorite Film from a specific studio. Studio Ghibli is one of my all-time favorite production companies and Hayao Miyazaki is another of my favorite directors.</p>
                        <p>Miyazaki's "Spirited Away" is a breathtaking masterpiece of animation that tells the story of a young girl named Chihiro who finds herself trapped in a mysterious and magical world. The film's stunning visuals, imaginative characters, and heartfelt storytelling make it a true cinematic gem that has captivated audiences of all ages.</p>
                        <p>One of the film's greatest strengths is its attention to detail. From the lush landscapes to the intricately designed creatures that inhabit the spirit world, every frame of "Spirited Away" is a work of art.</p>
                        <p>The animation is fluid and expressive, bringing the characters to life in a way that is both realistic and fantastical. Joe Hisaishi’s score is also beautiful and perfectly fits the film. This movie holds a special place in my heart.</p>
                        <br>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/EmpireStrike.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“No... I am your father”</blockquote>
                        <p>It would not be a stretch to say that Star Wars was the entire basis of my life growing up. I was wholeheartedly in love with this series. What might you ask started this love? The Empire Strikes Back. This movie was so cool to me. It singlehandedly started a decade-long near-obsession.</p>
                        <p>Considered one of the greatest sequels of all time, What sets "The Empire Strikes Back" apart from other blockbusters is its depth and complexity. The film explores themes of identity, destiny, and the nature of good and evil, adding a level of philosophical depth that is often missing from mainstream cinema.</p>

                        <br>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“Well, we movie stars get the glory. I guess we have to take the little heartaches that go with it. People think we lead lives of glamour and romance, but we're really lonely - terribly lonely.”</blockquote>
